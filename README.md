<b>WHAT IS KNAPSACK PROBLEM?</b>
<br>
The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem in computer science and mathematics. It involves selecting a subset of items from a larger set, subject to certain constraints, in order to maximize a specific objective function.
<br>
In the standard version of the knapsack problem, we are given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, and a knapsack with a maximum weight capacity. The goal is to select a combination of items that fits within the knapsack capacity and maximizes the total value of the selected items.

In this code users will be able to choose the capacity of knapsack, number of items and weights or values of items.
